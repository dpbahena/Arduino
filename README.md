# Arduino-with-micro-ros

Programs:
1. Acceleration-ros_publisher
    This program contains two publishers. It uses a Portenta H7 with an attached MPU6050 sensor.
    Publisher #1 publishes on topic "imu6050"
    Publisher #2 publishes on topic "temp6050"
2. Portenta_custom_message_micro_ros_publisher.ino
    This program has the same function as above but only 1 publisher. I used a custom message.
